        <h1>Skiing Without Snow? <span class="cinnamon-slash-container"><span class="slash slash-left"></span><span class="cinnamon-highlight">Summer</span><span class="slash slash-right"></span></span> Adventure</h1>

        <p>In the winter, Whistler-Blackcomb is a top ski resort that Washingtonians flee to when the snow here is more like ice and exposed rock. (Yes, I did indeed have a major repair on my skis because of said exposed rock—thank you, Crystal Mountain and global warming.) With perfect snow, peak conditions, and a beautiful view, who wouldn’t want to go? Now, what happens when you take away all the snow—what is left? Is it even worth it to go during the summer? Should I bring my skis just in case a giant storm comes in and there just so happens to be snow on the mountain?</p>
        <p>Don’t be worried, loyal blog readers, I have the answers, as I went to the ski resort when it had no snow for six days and am ready to tell all the secrets. For context, I stayed in a “ski-in, ski-out” condo on Blackcomb Mountain in mid-August and went with my ferocious Mini Schnauzer, who barks at everyone and everything he sees, yet stops if you pet him. (I don’t know why either—it’s a Schnauzer thing.)</p>
        <p>The first thing people need to pack if they go to Whistler in the summer is a bike. Do not bring skis, I promise, this is not a Mount Hood situation. A bike is the perfect way to get around Whistler without a car and even to go on the mountain itself. Riders enjoy an exhilarating, steep way down without the pain of going uphill, thanks to the chairlifts. There are even competitions for those experts out there! Alas, I am not an expert and do not even own a mountain bike, but luckily for me, there are lots of less intense and paved trails right outside of the mountain. I did, however, borrow my dad’s mountain bike, which made the gravel trails much smoother and very entertaining.</p>
        <p>Now, I can’t talk about bikes without touching on the very controversial topic: e-bikes. These machines have infested U.S. bike trails and streets in the span of a few years; they are absolutely everywhere. Everyone has their own opinions on this electric type of transportation, but you did not come here to read everyone’s opinion—you came to read mine. My qualifications are as follows: I have ridden an e-bike approximately twice but do not own one. I do, however, own a road bike and cherish it deeply.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, e-bikes should not be considered part of the sport of cycling because, well, riding one is not a sport. You have the potential to not do any exercise at all, making it much more similar to a motorcycle than a normal bike. There are some bikes that even have a throttle, similar to a Lime scooter, where you press it and it will zoom you away using 100% battery and 0% human effort. I will admit, riding an e-bike is fun, but I refuse to put it in the same category as non-electric bikes. But yes, if you were wondering, you can rent e-bikes in Whistler and test one out for yourself.</p>
        <p>Another thing to take note of is the sheer number of hikes in the area. I hiked at least once a day, yet I still have so many hikes on my to-do list. Most of the hikes around Whistler are dog-friendly, and even though my dog is 18 pounds and looks like a teddy bear with a beard, he is more athletic than me and climbs mountains like it’s no problem—so best believe he is going on these hikes.

Scared of dogs but not hikes? The Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort does not allow pet dogs up the mountain, but they do allow humans. I bought a ticket for one day to go up the Blackcomb gondola and see what hikes they had up there. I was met with a breathtaking view of the mountains and lakes around me and immediately loved it. I hiked the Overlord Trail to Lakeside Loop, which I totally recommend.</p>
        <p>Now, on to the terrifying part. I believe it was Eleanor Roosevelt who said, “Do something that scares you every day.” Well, I had the wonderful, lovely, spectacular idea of going on the Cloudraker Skybridge on Whistler Peak. To get there from Blackcomb, I took the PEAK 2 PEAK gondola across the two mountains. (Which was the least scary part of this whole experience, to put it into perspective) I then walked down a hill to the Peak Chair, which was very exposed and windy.</p>
        <p>Facing it straight on, the bridge looks stable (as stable as a cantilevered walkway can be) and not too long; however, once I took my first step, everything changed. What hit me first was the wind—wind like I have never experienced before: hat-clutching, North-Sea-crossing-type wind that was making the whole bridge sway from side to side, because naturally, it was not scary enough as is. Suddenly, this “fun bridge crossing” turned into a race to get to the other side; 426 feet had never felt so long. With the occasional look down and cardiac arrest, I made it to the other side… and then had to return on the bridge. But if this sounds like a good time and you are willing to have a few years of your life taken off, by all means, cross this bridge.</p>

        <p>All in all, this snowless mountain had many surprises up its sleeve, and I was impressed with what it had to offer. But for the important question everyone has been waiting for, is Whistler better in the summer or the winter? My answer is: that depends on what you like more—biking or skiing, hot or cold, falling off a suspension bridge or completely wiping out on a double black diamond. It is ultimately up to you, but don’t write the summer off without trying it first.</p>
